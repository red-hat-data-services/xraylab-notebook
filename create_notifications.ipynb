    "- A notebook is an environment where you have *cells* that can display formatted text (like the present cell), or code (as you will see below).\n",
    "- Code cells contain Python code that can be run interactively. Thats means you can modify the code, as you will do in the first code cell, then run it. The code will not run on you computer or in the browser, but directly on the server you are connected to.\n",
    "- To run a code cell, just select it (click in the cell, or on the left side of it), and click the \"Run/Play\" button from the toolbar.\n",
    "- You can also press CTRL+Enter to run a cell, or Shift+Enter to run the cell and automatically select the following one.\n",
    "- You can navigate between cells with Up and Down arrows (on your keyboard or in the toolbar).\n",
